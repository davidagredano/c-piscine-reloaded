# C Piscine Reloaded

These exercises are my way of revisiting and reinforcing all the fundamental C programming concepts I learned during the C Piscine ([visit my Piscine repo](https://github.com/davidagredano/c-piscine)). From functions and loops to pointers and structures, this is my chance to review and solidify foundations of C that I first explored.
